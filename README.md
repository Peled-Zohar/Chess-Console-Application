How to Play

The game is played by entering commands in the command-line interface.
Each player takes turns to make a move by entering the origin and destination squares of the piece they want to move.
Follow the standard algebraic notation for moves (e.g., "e2 e4" to move the pawn from e2 to e4).
Example of castling: "e1 g1" (for white kingside castling) or "e8 g8" (for black kingside castling).
